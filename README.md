## Problems

### Problem 1 - Sorting

Given a list of random unordered numbers, write a function that sort them in ascending order.

Input: 21, 400, 8, -3, 77, 99, -16, 55, 111, -36, 28

Expected output: -36, -16, -3, 8, 21, 28, 55, 77, 99, 111, 400

 def sort_numbers(numbers): //define the sort function - and the variable
    return sorted(numbers)

numbers = [21, 400, 8, -3, 77, 99, -16, 55, 111, -36, 28]
sorted_numbers = sort_numbers(numbers)
print(sorted_numbers)
Note:
- You are not allowed to use language library function to solve the problem.
- **Bonus**: Prepare space-time complexity analysis for your solution.

### Problem 2 - FizzBuzz

Given a list of ordered numbers from 1 to 100, perform the following actions
- For every number divisible by 3, print 'Fizz'
- For every number divisible by 5, print 'Buzz'
- For every number divisible by both 3 and 5, print 'FizzBuzz'

Input: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, ..., 100

Expected output: 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16, ..., 100
do{
int a = 0;
printf("Enter numbers")
scanf("%d",&a);
}while(a <100);
for(int i=0; i<100; i++){
if(a %3 ==0)
printf("\nFizz")
else if(a %5 ==0)
printf("Buzz");
else if(a %5 == 0 && a%3 ==0)
printf("Fizzbuzz"):
else{
break();
}
}

### Problem 3 - Fibonacci Sequence

Write a function that generate Fibonacci sequence using `recursion` technique. Allow the user to specify the number of Fibonacci sequence elements to generate.

Expected output: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

Note:
- Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
- **Bonus**: How would you handle preventing a stack overflow exception when generating a large sequence?

### Problem 4 - Find List Intersection

Write a function that find the intersection between two lists.

List 1: 4, 5, 2, 3, 1, 6

List 2: 8, 7, 6, 9, 4, 5

Expected output: 4, 5, 6

Note:
- You are not allowed to use language library function to solve the problem.
- **Bonus**: Prepare space-time complexity analysis for your solution.

### Problem 5 - Find List Symmetric Difference

Write a function that find the symmetric difference between two lists.

List 1: 4, 5, 2, 3, 1, 6

List 2: 8, 7, 6, 9, 4, 5

Expected output: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9

Note:
- You are not allowed to use language library function to solve the problem.
- **Bonus**: Prepare space-time complexity analysis for your solution.

### Problem 6 - Find Character with Maximum Occurence

Write a function that takes a string as input and finds the character that occurs the maximum number of times in the string. Return both the character and its occurrence count. If there are multiple characters with the same maximum occurrence, return any one of them.

Input: "Hello, world!"

Expected output: Character: 'l', Occurrence: 3

Note:
- Consider case-sensitivity, so 'H' and 'h' are different characters.
- The input string may contain whitespaces and punctuation. Ignore whitespaces and punctuation.
- **Bonus**: Handle Unicode characters correctly. Unicode characters refer to characters that are part of the Unicode character set. The Unicode character set is a standard system that assigns a unique numerical value (code point) to every character, including letters, numbers, symbols, and special characters from various writing systems around the world. This includes characters from languages like Chinese, Arabic, Hindi, Cyrillic, etc, as well as special characters and symbols from various scripts.

### Problem 7 - Square Root

Write a function that calculates and returns the square root of a non-negative integer `x`. You can safely assume `x` is a perfect square, such as 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, and so on.
int x = 0;
printf
Note:
- You are not allowed to use any built-in square root function or language library function to solve the problem.
- **Bonus**: Prepare space-time complexity analysis for your solution.

### Problem 8 - Anagram Checker

Write a function that takes two strings as input and checks if they are anagrams of each other. Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase.

Example 1:
- Input: "listen", "silent"
- Expected output: true
- Explanation: Both strings contain the same characters "l", "i", "s", "t", "e", and "n" and have the same count for each character. Hence, they are anagrams of each other.

Example 2:
- Input: "debit card", "Bad credit"
- Expected output: true
- Explanation: After removing whitespace and ignore case sensitivity, both strings contain the same characters "d", "e", "b", "i", "t", "c", "a", and "r" and have the same count for each character. Hence, they are anagrams of each other.


Example 3:
- Input: "hello", "bye"
- Expected output: false
- Explanation: Both strings contain different characters and have different lengths. Hence, they are not anagrams of each other.


Example 4:
- Input: "restful", "fluster"
- Expected output: false
- Explanation: Both strings contain the same characters "r", "e", "s", "t", "f", "u", and "l", but the counts of each character are different. Hence, they are not anagrams of each other.


Example 5:
- Input: "listen", "silentt"
- Expected output: false
- Explanation: The first string contains the characters "l", "i", "s", "t", "e", and "n", while the second string contains an extra "t". Hence, they are not anagrams of each other.

Example 6:
- Input: "Conversation", "Voices, rant on"
- Expected output: true
- Explanation: After removing whitespace and punctuation and ignore case sensitivity, both strings contain the same characters "c", "o", "n", "v", "e", "r", "s", "a", "t", "i", and "n" and have the same count for each character. Hence, they are anagrams of each other, even though the second string has different words, whitespaces, punctuation and cases.

Note: 
- Ignore case sensitivity, so "Listen" and "silent" should be considered anagrams.
- Ignore whitespace and punctuation from the anagram check.
- **Bonus**: Prepare space-time complexity analysis for your solution.

### Problem 9 - Node Path Existence

You are given a directed graph represented by its nodes and edges. Each node is identified by a unique label. The nodes in graph may contain cycles or may not be connected. Write a function that takes the graph, start node, and end node as inputs and returns two pieces of information:

1. A boolean value indicating whether a connected path exists between the specified nodes.
2. The connected path itself, if it exists.

Here is an example of the graph:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A((A))
    B((B))
    C((C))
    D((D))
    E((E))
    F((F))
    G((G))
    H((H))
    A --> B
    B --> A
    B --> C
    B --> D
    D --> G
    D --> E
    B --> E
    E --> F
    F --> B
    C --> F
    F --> G
```

Example 1:
- Input: Start = D, End = B
- Expected output: False

Example 2:
- Input: Start = F, End = A
- Expected output: True (F --> B --> A)

Example 3:
- Input: Start = G, End = C
- Expected output: False

Example 4:
- Input: Start = E, End = D
- Expected output: True (E --> F --> B --> D)

Note:
- You are free to propose any data structure to represent the directed graph.
- **Bonus**: Ensure that the function always returns the shortest connected path if it exists (assuming each edge has the same weight).
